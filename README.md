# Gapminder-Plotly
Interactive Plotting and Charting with Plotly Express on Gapminder Dataset.

Made this project in August 2020 to learn how to make charts interactive using Plotly. Followed brilliant tutorial by Snehan Kekre for this project.

# Project details
Generated following plots using Gapminder dataset:-
- Bar charts showing changes in population of India over the decades.
- Scatter Plot of GDP per capita vs Life Expectency of each continent.
- Bubble chart using scatter plot decpicting GDP per capita vs Life Expectency of countries across continents.
- Animated Bubble chart showing changes in GDP per capita vs Life Expectency over the decades.
- line_geo plot in orthogonal projection
- Animated choropleth showing changes in life expectency of countries in the world across the decades.
- Line plot of life expectency of countries over the years.
- Area plot of life expectency of countries over the years.

Due to this project I learnt more about plotly express and creating interactive and animated charts and gained knowledge about different types of plots and their uses.
Also gained new information from the plots generated and understood relationship between gdp per capita and life expectency.

# Note 
Dataset sourced directly from plotly and it is being fetched and loaded directly into the notebook.
